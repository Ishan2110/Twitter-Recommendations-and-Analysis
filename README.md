### Aim of the project is:

1. To use the classification techniques to develop a desktop application system for filtering out the useful information from the raw data and to analyze the reviews carried out by twitter. Millions of tweets are posted daily which contain opinions of users around the world. By this application user can just find out the ratings given by the people worldwide (analyzed by the system) and thus could take the decision of spending over a product or not.
2. To develop a system that could post such recommendations of the product to the target audience (decided on the basis of the past’s few tweets of the user).

### Some of the Libraries used in the project are:
* tweepy in Python
* twitteR - R package
* os in python
* csv in python
* NLP
* text2vec
* wordcloud 

Naïve-Bayes classifier is used as classification technique as it performs better than any other classifier as it works on independent features and the degree of class overlapping is small.
