# Twitter Recommendations and Analysis

### Aim of the project is:

1. To use the classification techniques to develop a desktop application system for filtering out the useful information from the raw data and to analyze the reviews carried out by twitter. Millions of tweets are posted daily which contain opinions of users around the world. By this application user can just find out the ratings given by the people worldwide (analyzed by the system) and thus could take the decision of spending over a product or not.
2. To develop a system that could post such recommendations of the product to the target audience (decided on the basis of the pastâ€™s few tweets of the user).
